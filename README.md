# Spotify-clone-with-customized-music-player-using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript

This project is a simple web-based music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mimicking a Spotify-like interface.
It includes a navigation bar (navbar) with a Spotify logo and menu links for Premium, Support, Download, Sign up, and Log in.

The changes that I have done are adding a customised music player using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
For going to the customised music player you need to click on the Spotify logo present in the navbar.

The main content consists of a list of songs, each displayed with a cover image, song name, and play icon.

The music player features play, pause, next, and previous controls with corresponding icons (fontawesome).

Song information such as name and progress bar is displayed at the bottom, along with a playing GIF.

The JavaScript code initializes an audio element and an array of songs with their details.

Event listeners handle play/pause clicks, time updates, and progress bar changes.

Clicking on individual songs updates the player to the selected song and starts playing it.

The "Next" and "Previous" buttons cycle through the song list.

The project provides a simple and interactive way to listen to a curated list of songs with basic playback controls.
